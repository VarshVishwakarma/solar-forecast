🌟 Overview

Reliable solar power forecasting is critical for grid stability and efficient energy management. This system integrates high-frequency generation data from Kaggle with localized meteorological data from NASA POWER (Bhopal region) to deliver:

Real-time Predictions: Inference based on temperature, humidity, and GHI.

Drift Monitoring: Automatic logging of predictions for future model retraining.

Interactive Visuals: Comparative analysis of historical trends vs. current live inputs.

🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a decoupled microservices pattern, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.

Key Components:

Backend (Inference Engine): A FastAPI service that manages model lifecycles and validates physical constraints (e.g., ensuring temperature is within realistic bounds).

Frontend (UX/UI): A Streamlit dashboard that provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and visualize results.

Data Pipeline: An ETL process that merges high-frequency power data with hourly NASA weather data.

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

Model Details

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Feature Set: ['temperature', 'humidity', 'ghi', 'hour_sin', 'hour_cos', 'power_t_1', 'power_t_2']

Normalization: StandardScaler applied to all numerical features.

Evaluation: Validated using TimeSeriesSplit to ensure temporal integrity, achieving high accuracy across RMSE and MAE metrics.

Feature Engineering

Temporal Encodings: Sin/Cos transformations for hours to capture diurnal cycles.

Lag Features: Inclusion of $Power_{t-1}$ and $Power_{t-2}$ to capture short-term momentum.
